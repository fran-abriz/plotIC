# plotIC
R plotting code I wrote which provides features such as color coding ('e' factors are always shown in reds, 'g' factors
are always shown in greens, etc.), custom axes, and more.  The graphics file in this git project was generated using
the code.

This code relies on some external modules for options and error handling.  These modules are not in the public domain.
